Requires the keepa Python module as well as access to the Keepa API. Written in Python, assisted by Jupyter Notebook.
Truth be told, I can't remember if this spits out the price histories into csv format cleanly. I was able to use this code myself for a project, though. I seem to recall maybe having to do minor polishing to the formatting after I got what I needed. I'm too lazy to test it out again. Plus, I don't have Keepa API access anymore, so there's that.
